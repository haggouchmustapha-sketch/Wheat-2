# Atlas Ledger feature matrix

Status reflects the audited 2.0.1 state after the bounded fixes recorded in `ATLAS_LEDGER_FIX_REPORT.md`. “WORKING” means an end-to-end implementation is supported by code and tests, not merely a visible route. Sage TXT is described as locally verified; a real Sage 100 import remains an external verification step.
