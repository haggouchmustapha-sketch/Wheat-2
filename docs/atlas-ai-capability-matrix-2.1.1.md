# Atlas AI capability matrix — 2.1.1

This inventory is derived from the 2.1.1 capability registry and the domain services invoked by the desktop UI. The executable registry remains the authority.

Risk semantics:

- Level 0: read or navigation; never mutates.
- Level 1: safe edit; executes immediately after explicit intent in Assistant and Automated modes.
- Level 2: accounting/conformity mutation; confirmed in Assistant mode and immediate only in Automated mode.
- Level 3: high impact; always previewed and confirmed immediately before execution.

| Module | Read | Level 1 | Level 2 | Level 3 | Reversal / notes |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| Company | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | Company updates use optimistic versioning. |
| Settings | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | Bounded consolidated settings read. |
| Accounts / PCGE | 2 | 1 | 0 | 1 | Official PCGE accounts remain immutable; custom accounts can be restored after archival. |
| Journals | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 | Archival is reversible by restoring the journal. |
| Fiscal years | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | Create/update only; no AI close command exists because no mature shared close command is exposed by this UI. |
| Entries | 3 | 1 | 2 | 3 | Draft deletion is destructive; posted entries are corrected only by the real reversal workflow. |
| Reports | 9 | 0 | 0 | 0 | Exact-cent reporting engines; no mutation. |
| Counterparties | 1 | 3 | 0 | 1 | Archive/restore use the subledger rules. |
| Invoices | 1 | 2 | 0 | 3 | Posting and voiding use subledger posting/reversal, never direct edits to posted records. |
| Payments | 1 | 2 | 1 | 4 | Allocation reversal and payment void use their accounting workflows. |
| Banking | 3 | 1 | 3 | 2 | Rapprochement and exclusion preserve evidence; void/restore follow reconciliation revisions. |
| Documents | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | Metadata search only. Fiscal/TVA attachment uses existing managed, hashed documents through those modules. |
| TVA | 3 | 0 | 4 | 4 | Review locks, evidence hashes, revisions and reopen rules remain enforced by compliance services. |
| Fiscal package/workpapers | 4 | 0 | 6 | 5 | Reviewed/N-A tables require explicit reopen; statutory export remains unavailable. |
| Ledger imports | 1 | 0 | 0 | 2 | Only already-managed staged batches can be confirmed/cancelled; no arbitrary path is accepted. |
| Payroll | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | Posted payroll is voided through the existing reversal workflow. |
| Audit | 2 | 0 | 0 | 0 | Bounded history and chain verification. |
| Company knowledge | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | Upsert is audited and dossier-scoped. |
| Navigation | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | Whitelisted application destinations only. |

Totals: 95 capabilities across 19 registry categories: 38 level 0, 12 level 1, 18 level 2, and 27 level 3. Fifty-seven mutation capabilities support dry-run.

Level 0 executes as a read/navigation operation. Level 1 executes immediately after explicit intent in Assistant or Automated mode. Level 2 executes immediately only in Automated mode and otherwise becomes a confirmation proposal. Level 3 always becomes a final confirmation proposal. Read-only mode rejects every L1–L3 capability.

## Operations intentionally not exposed

- Arbitrary SQL, Prisma, database, shell and filesystem access: prohibited by the Atlas AI boundary.
- Document upload/delete and bank-statement/ledger-file staging from a path: current desktop flows begin with a native file picker and managed-file ingestion. They need a future trusted attachment-token command before they can be exposed without handing the model a path or file bytes.
- Backup/restore and workspace reset: destructive filesystem/database lifecycle operations are not appropriate agent capabilities in this release.
- Statutory fiscal export/télédéclaration: Atlas Ledger itself marks this unavailable.
- Fiscal-year close: the application has lower-level closing machinery, but not a single mature user command in the current shared operations service that can safely be delegated here.

## Shared service boundary

The registry performs strict schema validation. The domain gateway then derives the active company from trusted IPC input, authorizes the signed-in user and membership, validates every referenced entity against that company, captures optimistic preconditions, and dispatches to `operations13`, `entryCommands21`, `reporting`, `reporting21`, `subledger`, `reconciliation`, `compliance14`, or `fiscal21`. The model receives no generic database or file tool.
